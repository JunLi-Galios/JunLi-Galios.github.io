* I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [IICS lab](https://iics.fudan.edu.cn/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). 
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, optimization, Bayesian learning,  information geometry, as well as their applications in meta-learning and computer vision.
* I received my Ph.D. Degree in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/) in 2020, advised by Prof.[Sinisa Todorovic](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sinisa/). 
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in mathematics at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2010.
