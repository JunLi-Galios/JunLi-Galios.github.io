* I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/), advised by Prof.[Sinisa Todorovic](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~sinisa/). [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dY3O3qsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)][[CV](Jun_Li_s_resume.pdf)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, optimization, Bayesian learning,  information geometry, as well as their applications in meta-learning and computer vision.
* I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). My undergraduate major is mathematics.
